# JavaScript Mini-Projects â€“ INSAT Workshop   

This repository contains four JavaScript mini-projects developed during the **Atelier JavaScript INSAT** workshop. Each project demonstrates different JavaScript concepts and user interactions.  

## Projects Overview  

### 1. Hidden Number Game  
A simple number-guessing game where the user tries to find a randomly generated number. The game includes three difficulty levels:  
- **Easy**: More attempts, wider range  
- **Intermediate**: Moderate attempts and range  
- **Hard**: Fewer attempts, limited range  

The game is implemented using `Math.random()`, `prompt()`, and `alert()`, and allows restarting without reloading the page.  

### 2. Mini Word Editor  
A basic text editor with simple customization options:  
- Users can change text color using a color picker  
- Font size can be adjusted through a number input  
- Font family can be selected from a dropdown list  

The project focuses on writing clean and modular code.  

### 3. Todo List Manager  
A simple to-do list application where users can add and remove. The functionality is based on an animation shown in the workshop slides.  

### 4. Random Color List  
An interactive ordered list (`<ol>`) where each list item (`<li>`) changes to a random color when clicked.
